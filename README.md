# AFLSmart: Smart Greybox Fuzzing
AFLSmart is a smart (input-structure aware) greybox fuzzer which leverages a high-level structural representation of the seed files to generate new files. It uses higher-order mutation operators that work on the virtual file structure rather than on the bit level which allows AFLSmart to explore completely new input domains while maintaining file validity. It uses a novel validity-based power schedule that enables AFLSmart to spend more time generating files that are more likely to pass the parsing stage of the program, which can expose vulnerabilities much deeper in the processing logic.

AFLSmart is an extension of [American Fuzzy Lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) (AFL) written and maintained by Michał Zalewski <<lcamtuf@google.com>>, and builds upon the [Peach Fuzzer Community Edition](http://www.peach.tech/resources/peachcommunity/) written and maintained by [PeachTech](https://www.peach.tech/). We thank PeachTech for making the community version open source.

Smart Greybox Fuzzing was developed by [Van-Thuan Pham](https://thuanpv.github.io/), [Marcel Böhme](https://mboehme.github.io/), [Andrew E. Santosa](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/andrew-santosa-68b2463b), [Alexandru Răzvan Căciulescu](https://ro.linkedin.com/in/alexandru-razvan-caciulescu-049699106), and [Abhik Roychoudhury](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/).

# Installation

## Prerequisites

Install automake and some required packages
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential automake libtool libc6-dev-i386 python-pip g++-multilib
```

Compile and install mono package to support C# on Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get install mono-complete
```
Install gcc-4.4 and g++-4.4 (as Pin component in Peach has a compilation issue with newer version of gcc like gcc-5.4)
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install gcc-4.4
sudo apt install g++-4.4
```

If you find that it just didn't work on your linux distribution and got failed at installing gcc/g++ 4.4 follow the commands below :

First edit the sources.list file :

```bash
sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
```
then add the following line to your sources.list file :

```bash
deb http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main universe
```

Now :

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install gcc-4.4
sudo apt install g++-4.4
```

(This should work on many distributions without any failure)


## AFLSmart

Download AFLSmart and compile it.
```
git clone https://github.com/aflsmart/aflsmart
cd aflsmart
make clean all
cd ..

export AFLSMART=$(pwd)/aflsmart
export WORKDIR=$(pwd)
```

## Modified version of Peach

```bash
cd $AFLSMART
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/peachfuzz/files/Peach/3.0/peach-3.0.202-source.zip
unzip peach-3.0.202-source.zip
patch -p1 < peach-3.0.202.patch
cd peach-3.0.202-source
CC=gcc-4.4 CXX=g++-4.4 ./waf configure
CC=gcc-4.4 CXX=g++-4.4 ./waf install
```

## Setup PATH environment variables

```bash
cd $AFLSMART
source $AFLSMART/setup_env.sh
```

# Usage

AFLSmart adds four more options to AFL

-w: input model type. AFLSmart currently only supports Peach.

-g: input model file. Path to the input model file (a.k.a Peach pit) is required. We have provided 10 sample Peach pits in the input_models folder. To write a new Peach pit for a new file format, please follow [this tutorial](http://community.peachfuzzer.com/v3/PeachQuickStart.html) and revisit [Section 4 - File Format Specification](https://thuanpv.github.io/publications/TSE19_aflsmart.pdf) of the AFLSmart paper.

-h: stacking mutations mode which mixes normal and higher-order mutation operators together. 

-H: limit the number of higher-order mutations for each input. This is an optional option; there is no limit if the option is not set.

TIFF extension:

-P: specify the path to a custom input file parser that is to be used instead of Peach.

Example command: 
```bash
afl-fuzz -h -i in -o out -w peach -g <input model file> -P parse_tiff_chunks.py -x <dictionary file> <executable binary and its arguments> @@
```

During the fuzzing process, AFLSmart will interact with Peach to get the validity and chunks' boundary information. Please check the out/chunks folder and make sure that it is not empty. If it is empty, Peach executable may not be found and you need to compile Peach and/or check the PATH environment variable.

# Examples

To fuzz WavPack and reproduce CVE-2018-10536. See [Section 2 - Motivating Example](https://thuanpv.github.io/publications/TSE19_aflsmart.pdf) in the AFLSmart paper.

## Compile the vulnerable version of WavPack
```bash
cd $WORKDIR
git clone https://github.com/dbry/WavPack.git
cd WavPack
git checkout 0a72951
./autogen.sh
CC=afl-gcc ./configure --disable-shared
make clean all
```
## Fuzz it in 24 hrs
```bash
cd $WORKDIR/WavPack
timeout 24h $AFLSMART/afl-fuzz -m none -h -d -i $AFLSMART/testcases/aflsmart/wav -o out -w peach -g $AFLSMART/input_models/wav.xml -x $AFLSMART/dictionaries/wav.dict -e wav -- ./cli/wavpack -y @@ -o out
```
